# Covid-Risk-Prediction-Analysis

COVID-19 has posed a worldwide health challenge, affecting millions and straining healthcare systems globally. Diverse patient outcomes from mild to severe cases underscore the need to comprehend these variations for better management. COVID-19, primarily causing mild to moderate respiratory illness, severely impacts those with various underlying health conditions. Predicting resource needs for COVID-19 patients is vital for efficient allocation and effective healthcare response.

The project focuses on a thorough analysis of the factors influencing the death risk level of COVID-19 patients. We perform EDA on the Covid-19 Dataset to draw meaningful insights from the data. For further analysis, we use statistical methods and tests for identifying the most significant features from the dataset that can be used in modeling the dataset.
